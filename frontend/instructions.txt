I typically separate CSS and JavaScript files for better organization and maintainability. 
However, it seems that you prefer everything within a single index.html file for simplicity. 

In this case, Iâ€™ve implemented the solution using vanilla React for states. 
("Vanilla React", what a statement, absolute modern JS moment)

All this is self taught through YT, FCC, and stack-overflow around 2016-2019.
If things don't conform to modern industry standards, more than happy to learn and change. 
I've yet to taken 6080 as that is later on in my program but I have done 1531

Also have mild experience with Next-js, shad-cn component libraries, and tailwindCSS. 
Not used here, seems a bit over kill.

Also have experience with: 
- boostrap
- jquery
- SASS 
- Redux
