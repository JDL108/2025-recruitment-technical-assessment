I typically separate CSS and JavaScript files for better organization and maintainability. 
However, it seems that you prefer everything within a single index.html file for simplicity. 

In this case, Iâ€™ve implemented the solution using vanilla React for states. 

All this is self taught through YT, FCC, and stack-overflow around 2016-2017.
If things don't conform to modern industry standards, more than happy to learn and change. 
I've yet to taken 6080 as that is later on in my program

Also have mild experience with Next-js, shad-cn component libraries, and tailwindCSS.
